    activated when there is something to print.Elements will be moved and printed only by one after
    passing through map and filter.

/*Chat-GPT
Java Streams are lazily evaluated. That means:
* Intermediate operations are just declared pipelines.
* Nothing happens until a terminal operation (like forEach, collect, count, etc.) is called.
*The terminal operation pulls data through the stream,triggering execution of the intermediate operations.
