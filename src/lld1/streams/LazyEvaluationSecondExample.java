/*
*Java streams are lazily evaluated, meaning intermediate operations (like filter)
are only executed when there's a terminal operation (forEach, collect, etc.).

*Because of short-circuiting behavior of limit(),
the stream stops processing once 5 even numbers are found.

*So, although the original list has 100 elements, not all of them are passed through the filter.
* It's not that the filter itself stops after reaching 10
â€” it's that the stream processes elements one-by-one in pull mode,
and once 5 even numbers have been passed to forEach, no more elements are requested or filtered.

* Relate from convear belt example before:
For convear belt to keep moving Terminal operation(PRINT) has to be active.

* In Streams if there is no terminal operation the intermediate operations will not execute at all.
